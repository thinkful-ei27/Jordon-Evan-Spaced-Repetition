# Spanish Learning App

This is the client side code for an app that teaches you Spanish vocabulary using a spaced repetition learning method. You'll be given a word to guess and receive feedback on your answers. The more often you are correct for any given word, the less often you'll see it. But if you mess up it's back to square one. you can also track your progress through the vocab chart on your dashboard.

The live version of the app can be found at https://spaced-repition-client.herokuapp.com  
the code for the back-end can be found at https://github.com/thinkful-ei27/Jordan-Evan-Spaced-Repetition-Backend
